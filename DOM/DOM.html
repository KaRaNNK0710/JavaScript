<!-- query selector selects the first html property and displays it on the console -->
 <!-- Use #idName to access any elemeny by its id and use .className to access any element by its class  -->
  <!-- NodeList has only foreach functionality compared to an array. So it depends on what you want to achieve if you want to convert the NodeList into an array -->
<!-- Similarly, htmlcollection can also be converted into an array as it doesn't have any functionality like array has -->
 <!-- This can be done like this-   Array.from(htmlcollection_Name) -->
<!-- Use document.getElementByClassName('class-name') to get the elements in the form of htmlcollection -->

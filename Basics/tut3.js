//Datatypes and ECMA standards
//"use strict"; this statement will treat your JS code as the newer version. But now it is not decalred explicitly, it is present in the code implicitly
// "alert" statement cannot be used in nodejs but can be used in browser because it is treated as a window object in the browser and it is strictly part of the front-end dev
// null -> standalone value i.e it is a separate data type. It is treated as an object
// symbol -> unique
// object 
console.log(typeof null); // object
console.log(typeof undefined); // undefined
